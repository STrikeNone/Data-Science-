## Welcome to Yi Hao's Portfolio. I am a incoming Year 2 student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (NTU). 

(For my reference) [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. 

This page aims to showcase my growth in knowledge and experience in Data Science. I will be focusing more on Neural Networks and the classical problems of Data Science here. Do check out my work in [Computer Vision](https://github.com/STrikeNone/OpenCV) in both C++ and Python.

[Revision Notes](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/CZ1016%20Notes%20Yi%20Hao.pdf) Feel free to take a look at my revision notes for Year 1 Semester 2 Mod CZ1016 Introduction to Data Science

[Full Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/EDA_Assignment.ipynb) Full EDA on a Dataset for Students with abit of Machine Learning

[Decision Trees](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/blob/main/Mini%20Project.ipynb) This is my first ever project in Data Science. I used a simple Decision Tree classifier to try and predict whether customers were going to leave a bank. 

[Linear Regression](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/Special%20Challenge%201.ipynb) Using Advertisement Sale Price Dataset from Kaggle, i attempt to use a Linear Regression Model to predict the Sale Price. I attempted both Uni and Multi-Variate Linear Regression and did some Exploratory Analysis on the Dataset as well. The Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ashydv/advertising-dataset).

[Shopee Hackathon 2021 Data Analytics Challenge](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/Shoppee%20%23%201%20Data%20Analytics.ipynb) 

[Random Forest with GridSearchCV](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/DecisionTree%20Challenge.ipynb) My first attempt at using GridSearchCV to try to identify the best features and hyperparameters to use

[Basic Movie Recommender](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/blob/main/Movie_Recommender.ipynb) This is my attempt at creating a simple recommender for movies. I used Count Vectorizers (which is like encoding words from my understanding and applied to NLP) on selected features and then applied Cosine Similarity on them in order to determine, the closest movies. The dataset i used was [Dataset](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/blob/main/IMDB%20Movies.csv) and the [Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueKXSupHz6Q&ab_channel=ComputerScience) that i referenced to.

[Intermediate Movie Recommender](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/Surprise-Movie/Surprise%20Movie.ipynb) Improving on the first movie recommender project, i did collaborative filtering in addition to content based filtering. I also tried to find ways to use the movies recommended to recommend me an ongoing movie in Golden Village (Theatre)

[Movie Recommender (Full Scale Project)](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/CZ1016_PuahYiHao_TohYongLi_WongYingXuan.ipynb) This is a full project i worked on with 2 other people for our CZ1016 Introduction to Data Science module. It is a movie recommender for Golden Village Singapore. We first did Data Handling/Cleaning, EDA and then applied Collaborative and Content Filtering. Certainly an eye opening project for me.

[Deep Learning](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20MNIST%20and%20Animals.ipynb) Convolutional Neural Network

[Neural Network Titanic](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/Titanic%20Neural%20Network.ipynb) Used a Neural Network w/ Sigmoid for the Titanic Dataset to achieve over 90%

[Recurrent Neural Network Name Classification](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks%20(RNN).ipynb) First attempt at RNN's to guess the language a name belongs to. Learned with reference to Python Engineers [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEV61GmmPrk). Will be attempting more in my free time
